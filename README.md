# Hi there, I'm Gabriel! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a bioinformatician and computational biologist at The Ohio State University with a passion for developing robust software solutions for complex biological problems. My work focuses on creating reproducible pipelines, machine learning models, and data visualization tools that advance research in neurodegenerative diseases.

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects

* **RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline**: A comprehensive Snakemake workflow for processing RNA-seq data that integrates QC, parameter optimization, trimming, STAR alignment, and feature quantification. The pipeline is designed with modular components, checkpoint validation, and seamless integration with high-performance computing environments.

* **scPrediXcan-DataFlow**: A GPU-accelerated pipeline for cell-type specific transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). This modular workflow processes multi-omic data from raw genotypes through Enformer deep learning outputs to cell-type specific gene expression predictions, enabling identification of cell-specific disease mechanisms.

* **Drug Clustering Analysis Tool**: An interactive visualization tool that clusters drugs based on pathway activation patterns. Using PCA dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering, it helps identify relationships between drugs with similar mechanisms of action and visualizes these in an explorable 3D space.

* **VCF Processing Workflow**: A robust Snakemake pipeline for quality control and processing of VCF files, featuring sample subsetting, MAF and depth filtering, and comprehensive QC reporting for genomic studies.

## ðŸŒ± Skills & Technologies

* **Languages**: Python, R, Shell scripting, CUDA, SQL
* **Workflow Management**: Snakemake, Nextflow
* **Bioinformatics**: RNA-seq, GWAS/TWAS, single-cell analysis, pathway analysis, variant calling
